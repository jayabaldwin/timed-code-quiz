## Description
For this project we were required to build an interactive quiz application. The purpose of this task was to prepare us for potential coding assessments or challenges we may be required to complete in the future as part of an interview process. 

This challenge provided the opportunity to implement what we have learned this past week, furthering the development of our JavaScript skills.

The timed quiz has to be composed of multiple choice questions and run in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML AND CSS powered by JavaScript that we write, no starter code provided. It must also have a a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.


## Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over

```
